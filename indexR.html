		<p>Interesting race we had on Sunday, (2/21/21)  we went from the high speed plate racing of the Daytona 500 to the technical Daytona road course. Last year after the pandemic stopped, 
		NASCAR decided to run as many races as possible in the Wild West of the 21st century, AKA Florida. Among those races NASCAR gave us the Daytona road course, a place where NASCAR has never raced. None of the drivers had any practice or qualifying, There was  absolutely no laps run other than simulators like iRacing or Project Cars for the poor boys. This made it exciting because the first few laps were expected to be chaos and they were definitely chaos, it was a good race. This race not so much </p>

		<p>It wasn&#39;t boring but it was uneventful. I think the fact that it was a short 250 mile road course race helped, also seeing all the drivers struggling with the track is entertaining. This race kinda reminded me of a Walmart version of a F1 race, a technical track with close racing in the back but a dominating leader in Chase Elliott. Even some wet weather drama in the last 17 laps but after that even though it took almost an hour, the last 15 laps were amazing. After dominating the whole race Chase Elliot does what he does and crashes out in the clinch part of the race, his car and ability was superior to anyone else this weekend. After he crashed, he made his way back to like 7th and then he spun out again. Logano took advantage of a late caution and held the lead in the final laps of the race but he didn’t manage his car well enough and his brakes overheated and lost the lead to the kid Christopher Bell. <p>

		<p>He was able to win his first Cup series race but at 	then end his asshole crew chief Adam Stevens didn&#39;t let him do a burnout because they needed to <q>save the motor<q>. He worked his entire life for this moment to win a NASCAR Cup Series race, under the bright lights of Daytona, and his crew chief didn&#39;t let him do a burnout? I&#39;m not sure who I&#39;m more angry at, The no fun crew chief, or Christopher Bell for being a pussy.</p>
