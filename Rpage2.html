		<h2> America Need a Miracle
		</h2>
	<div class="container">
	<p>After the last few years one thing all Americans can agree on is that this country is in disarray. We&#39;re falling behind in areas of success to countries like Sweden, Switzerland and God help us Russia.We need a leader, someone who can revitalize America to the success that we once had. I believe that leader is... Austin Matthews.</p>

	<p>Oh you thought this is about politics? No this is about what&#39;s really important in life, Hockey. 
	America is good at alot of things like stock car racing, slow cooked barbecue, being fat, but what we&#39;re not good at is hockey. Americans aren&#39t bad at hockey compared to Great Britain, Japan and Kazakhstan but there are over 286 USA born hockey players in the NHL, more than any other country other than Canada. We have good enough players to do better than what we have done recently. The only ones to blame are USA hockey management.</p> 

	<p>I know it&#39;s kind of a ridiculous ask for the USA to put as much time into their hockey program as Canada does but that&#39;s what we need. For decades USA hockey management just sat down together in a room throwing together just random players out of a hat. The top six are usually good but the bottom six are usually completely random. The USA hockey GM is Chris Drury. </p>

	<p>He&#39;s arguably one of the best college hockey players to ever live, and if his NHL career didn&#39;t get stopped by injury he probably could&#39;ve put together a Hall of Fame campaign. As GM of the Hartford Wolfpack, his results are a fraction of the success that he had as a player. He became the GM of the Wolfpack in 2017 and since then his team had a under .500 record and has never made a playoffs. So based on that what the fuck makes him qualified to be a GM of an Olympic hockey team. Are there no other qualified American GM&#39;s in hockey? Why not his boss Jeff Gorton Who consistently makes the Rangers a successful team? Why not Mr. No fun Lou Lamoriello, if Anybody can whip the American team into shape it&#39;s Lou Lamoriello, just look at what he did to the Islanders they were a completely different team just by his presents. One of the plus sides that we can look at for the future of USA hockey is the players. Austin Matthews, Johnny Goudreau, and Jack Eichel are all new names that are coming into the Olympic scene, hopefully Chris Drury Will be able to put together a team without any fourth liners on it. </p>

	<p> America has two World junior championships in the last five years, American hockey is on the rise and it&#39;s only been 41 years since our last gold. Hopefully in 2022 the Americans can put together A hockey dream team with superstars on all four lines and this generation of American kids could live through our own miracle </p>
