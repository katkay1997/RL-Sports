	<h1>Is The God Damn Pandemic good for outdoor games? </h1>
	<hr>

	<div class="container">

	<p>Recently the NHL has blessed us with 2 games at Lake Tahoe this year, a place most known for its drug and alcohol use will be the setting for two divisional rivalry games. I remember watching every winter classic and outdoor game the NHL has put on, usually the buildup and the different camera angles are cool but recently outdoor games have felt repetitive, I mean I can&#39;t even remember the scores of the last few and after the disaster at the Cotton Bowl where someone literally died I think we are starting to learn that these old classic stadiums may not be the best option for a negative degree hockey game. I understand that they could play football in those same stadiums, in the same conditions but let&#39;s all be honest Football fans Built Different then hockey fans.</p> 

	<p>When this pandemic started and I learned that I wouldn&#39;t be able to go to any games live for the forcible future I got depressed, but once I got over that I looked at the empty arenas as an opportunity for sports to give us something different. It could have been a different looking arena or different camera angles. I thought the NBA and MLS made their playoffs more interesting with the huge TV in the back. I thought the NHL bubble arenas were disappointing and the gray couldn&#39;t be more boring. </p>

	<p>Now let&#39;s go to Lake Tahoe, come on guys. I could have seen the NHL take this opportunity to get fans to watch games but I&#39;m actually happy they decided to not put any stands around the rink. Originally I thought they were gonna play on the frozen lake, I am an idiot. So when I saw the beautiful sheet of ice on the beach of lake Tahoe my jaw dropped, it&#39;s by far the best outdoor rink the NHL has ever made. I love how simple it is. It&#39;s just the roots of hockey, and with the Sierra Nevada mountains in the background like an Ansel Adams photo it was perfect, and I thought it was just as cool at night, in the pitch black dark and just a few floodlights the players looked like they were on a homemade out-door rink. I hope the NHL keeps the zero capacity outdoor game for the future, I want to see the islanders vs Rangers at MetLife stadium as much as anyone, I also want to see a game in AT&T Stadium with 110,000 people packed in there but there is something special about these empty games maybe if the NHL has one empty outdoor game where they could use the environment as the the background I would love that. They could use it as a pandemic awareness game to constantly remind us how close are way of life could change at any moment due to a microscopic virus. Or they could have Bridgestone sponsor it and make a fuck ton of money. </p>
